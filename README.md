#  Food Delivery App Data Modeling and Analysis
**Description:**
This SQL project showcases the design and implementation of a Snowflake schema for a food delivery app using the [DB Designer](https://www.dbdesigner.net/), an online database schema design and modeling tool. The Snowflake schema provides an efficient and normalized structure for organizing app-related data.

**Key Features:**

* <ins>Snowflake Schema Design:</ins> Utilizing the DB Designer, the project encompasses the creation of a robust Snowflake schema tailored to the specific requirements of the food delivery app. The schema optimizes data organization, enabling seamless data retrieval and analysis.

* <ins>Oracle's LiveSQL Analysis:</ins> Leveraging Oracle's LiveSQL, a web-based SQL editor with an embedded Oracle database, the project delves into the analysis of food delivery app data. This powerful platform allows for querying, exploration, and answering 22 real-world questions related to app operations, user behavior, order trends, and more.

* <ins>Real-World Questions:</ins> The project goes beyond schema design to address practical challenges faced in the food delivery industry. By answering 22 real-world questions, the project provides actionable insights and data-driven solutions for app optimization and business growth.
